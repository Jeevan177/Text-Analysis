# Text-Analysis

Text Analysis ia a process used to extract meaningful information and insights from unstructured text data, including documents, emails, social media posts, customer reviews, and more.
Text analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and making sense of large volumes of text data.
## Steps to follow for text analysis:
1. Gathering the text data.
2. Clean and preprocess the text data.
3. Convert the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.
4. Analyze the text data to gain insights.
5. Create relevant features from the text data if necessary.
6. Select appropriate NLP models for your task.

# NLP Technique:
NER is a natural language processing technique used to identify and extract specific entities such as organizations, locations, names, dates, and more from the text. 

Next, we applied LDA using the LatentDirichletAllocation model with five topics as an example. The resulting topic matrix represents each articleâ€™s distribution across these five topics. Then, we assign a dominant topic to each article based on the topic with the highest probability, and a bar chart is generated to visualize the distribution of dominant topics across the dataset, providing an overview of the prevalent themes or subjects discussed in the articles.
